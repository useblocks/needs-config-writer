:Released: 28.10.2025
:Full Changelog: `v0.2.0...v0.2.1 <https://github.com/useblocks/needs-config-writer/compare/0.2.0...76b32b4>`__

This releases adds quality-of-life improvements and minor fixes.

- üìö Restructure docs (:pr:`10` and :pr:`11`)

  A ``Motivation`` page was added to explain about problems and use-cases.
  Also an example for complex setups was added to illustrate how this extension
  can be used in real-world scenarios.

- üîß Return metadata in setup (:pr:`12`)

  The extension now returns metadata such as version and whether it can be run in parallel
  in the ``setup()`` call.

- üëå New config needscfg_exclude_vars (:pr:`13`)

  A new configuration option ``needscfg_exclude_vars`` was added to customize
  which Sphinx-Needs configuration variables are excluded from the exported TOML file.
  See :ref:`excluded_configs` for details.

- ‚ú® Merge additional TOML files (:pr:`14``)

  A new configuration option ``needscfg_merge_toml_files`` was added to specify
  additional TOML files to merge into the exported ``ubproject.toml``.
  This allows to combine static configuration files with the dynamically generated one.

.. _`release:0.2.0`:

0.2.0
-----

:Released: 28.10.2025
:Full Changelog: `v0.1.0...v0.2.0 <https://github.com/useblocks/needs-config-writer/compare/0.1.0...e457d2f>`__

This release reduce the complexity of content comparison and improves the configuration.
It's not backwards compatible as most of the configuration changed. Please check the updated documentation.

- ‚ôªÔ∏è Remove hash based comparison (:pr:`8`)

  The configuration ``needscfg_use_hash`` was renamed to :ref:`config_warn_on_diff`.
  Hashing is not required as the content can be compared directly.
  This is simpler with less config and less dependencies.
  Default is ``True``.

  :ref:`config_overwrite` now checks in all cases whether to overwrite differing files.
  Default is ``False`` to prevent accidental overwrites.

  The configuration ``needscfg_write_defaults`` was renamed to :ref:`config_write_all`
  to be more explicit about what it does. If enabled, all known Sphinx-Needs configuration is written,
  including defaults and not only explicitly set values.
  Default is ``False``.

  Fix sorting of ``needs_extra_options`` which maybe given as ``list[str]`` or ``list[dict]``.
  For the latter case it is sorted by the ``name`` key.
