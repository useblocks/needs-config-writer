0.2.2
-----

:Released: 29.10.2025
:Full Changelog: `v0.2.1...v0.2.2 <https://github.com/useblocks/needs-config-writer/compare/0.2.1...dafab78>`__

- ‚ú® New needscfg builder (:pr:`18`)

  A new Sphinx builder called ``needscfg`` was added to generate the
  ``ubproject.toml`` file without building the entire documentation.
  This allows to quickly generate or update the configuration file as needed.

  Additionally, the event for configuration collection was changed
  from ``config-inited`` to ``env-before-read-docs`` to ensure that the Sphinx-Needs
  configuration is fully loaded.

- üëå Print diff (:pr:`17`)

  When configuration differs and :ref:`config_warn_on_diff` is ``True``,
  the actual differences between the existing and new configuration
  are now printed to the console for easier debugging.

.. _`release:0.2.1`:

0.2.1
-----

:Released: 28.10.2025
:Full Changelog: `v0.2.0...v0.2.1 <https://github.com/useblocks/needs-config-writer/compare/0.2.0...76b32b4>`__

This releases adds quality-of-life improvements and minor fixes.

- üìö Restructure docs (:pr:`10` and :pr:`11`)

  A ``Motivation`` page was added to explain about problems and use-cases.
  Also an example for complex setups was added to illustrate how this extension
  can be used in real-world scenarios.

- üîß Return metadata in setup (:pr:`12`)

  The extension now returns metadata such as version and whether it can be run in parallel
  in the ``setup()`` call.

- üëå New config needscfg_exclude_vars (:pr:`13`)

  A new configuration option ``needscfg_exclude_vars`` was added to customize
  which Sphinx-Needs configuration variables are excluded from the exported TOML file.
  See :ref:`excluded_configs` for details.

- ‚ú® Merge additional TOML files (:pr:`14`)

  A new configuration option ``needscfg_merge_toml_files`` was added to specify
  additional TOML files to merge into the exported ``ubproject.toml``.
  This allows to combine static configuration files with the dynamically generated one.

.. _`release:0.2.0`:

0.2.0
-----

:Released: 28.10.2025
:Full Changelog: `v0.1.0...v0.2.0 <https://github.com/useblocks/needs-config-writer/compare/0.1.0...e457d2f>`__

This release reduce the complexity of content comparison and improves the configuration.
It's not backwards compatible as most of the configuration changed. Please check the updated documentation.

- ‚ôªÔ∏è Remove hash based comparison (:pr:`8`)

  The configuration ``needscfg_use_hash`` was renamed to :ref:`config_warn_on_diff`.
  Hashing is not required as the content can be compared directly.
  This is simpler with less config and less dependencies.
  Default is ``True``.

  :ref:`config_overwrite` now checks in all cases whether to overwrite differing files.
  Default is ``False`` to prevent accidental overwrites.

  The configuration ``needscfg_write_defaults`` was renamed to :ref:`config_write_all`
  to be more explicit about what it does. If enabled, all known Sphinx-Needs configuration is written,
  including defaults and not only explicitly set values.
  Default is ``False``.

  Fix sorting of ``needs_extra_options`` which maybe given as ``list[str]`` or ``list[dict]``.
  For the latter case it is sorted by the ``name`` key.

.. _`release:0.1.0`:

0.1.0
-----

:Released: 28.10.2025

Initial release of ``Needs-Config-Writer``

This version allows to write Sphinx-Needs TOML
configuration files automatically during Sphinx builds
to a customisable location.

Hash checking is supported to warn about changed configurations.
